Hit-Boy

Uh, in the Rolls truck, waitin' for the light change (hah)
Thinking damn, I came from the bottom, look how my life changed
And all I did was write pain
But I'm still runnin' the streets, mama hope one day I might change (cash)

My road through the trenches wasn't the cleanest (not at all)
I know I ain't perfect, I lied, and I cheated
I know some of the shit I was doin' was too egregious
Told my girl, "I apologize", this time, I mean it (I mean that shit)

You know I got a good heart, yo, you seen it
Look at all the niggas I look out for and people I'm feedin' (know how I move)
Yeah, I had a son a lil' while after (hah)
And when he died, know it was hard for you to smile after (cash)

While all that was goin' on, I had a child after (pssh)
So how the fuck I'm 'posed to be a proud rapper? (Hah)
Story of my life, shit got wild chapters (talk to 'em, cash)

I'm so fried all day, on my grind always
Seen some foul, foul times in this wild, wild life
And I ain't even trippin', no
Since the world we live in is so cold

Uh, been dealing and sinning from the beginning (uh-huh)
Do whatever it take to make double profit percentage (sheesh)
From the stoops and the benches to 'partment project with fences (man)
Shit, we out here tryna get up out the trenches (yup)

Elevate your comprehension, consolidate your vision (oh)
If you were born to stand out, you wasn't meant to fit in (uh-huh)
Remember, car too clean to let a sucka sit in
This trap music shit mad, show you how it began

In every loss, you find a lesson, make a life investment (woo)
But up to then, man, live a trap life, the shit these rap niggas act like
See, I know how it feel to be behind the wheel (woo)
With a trunk full of dope, blue lights in the mirror

License and insurance, give it to 'em, chill (man)
You either play this shit perfect or you go to jail
From hopin' I ain't got no warrants to Florence, Italy tourin'
Machine and the King, from Bankhead beyond (God damn)

I'm so fried all day, on my grind always
Seen some foul, foul times in this wild, wild life
And I ain't even trippin', no
Since the world we live in is so cold

And I ain't even trippin', no
Since the world we live in is so cold

I put it all on the line, these the signs of the times
Tryna keep peace of mind, guess I'm flawed by design
Pray to God to keep my sister alive
Down the Hennessy to keep the memories from fallin' out of my eyes

I seen some wild chapters (uh-huh)
Dealt with grief through all stages (uh)
Turnin' all the pages, deeper than Neil Gaiman
The world's in a hurry, it's hard to instill patience (uh)
Yeah, we due for reparations and niggas is still waitin'

I sit in silence, lookin' for silver lining
I feel like Robin Williams, laughin' to keep from cryin'
You'd understand too, if you only stood where I am
On the hills of Jerusalem, in the city of Zion

I'm so fried all day, on my grind always
Seen some foul, foul times in this wild, wild life
And I ain't even trippin', no
Since the world we live in is so cold

So cold, so cold, so cold
